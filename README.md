# Scene It

**Scene It** is a revolutionary writing tool designed to help writers create, experiment with, and refine stories in an intuitive, scene-driven way. Whether you’re crafting a screenplay, novel, or interactive narrative, Scene It provides a flexible framework for storytelling and AI-assisted guidance.

---

## Overview

At its core, **Scene It** treats a story as a **linear path of scenes** within a **web of scene drafts**. This enables writers to explore multiple creative directions without losing track of earlier ideas.

- **Scene Variants:** Swap out drafts of a scene on a whim to explore alternate outcomes.
- **AI-Generated Templates:** Start with a summary and instantly generate a workable scene structure.
- **Story Flow Optimization:** Unsure which scene fits best? AI suggests optimal ordering and pacing.
- **Script Grading:** Compare your script's structure against award-winning works.

## Features

### Scene Management

- Create, edit, and organize scenes in a highly flexible structure.
- Add multiple **variants** of the same scene.
- Instantly switch between drafts to test pacing or character arcs.

### AI-Assisted Writing

- Generate scene templates based on short summaries.
- Receive suggestions for improving consistency, clarity, and narrative coherence.
- Detect deviations from character motivations or established arcs.

### Script Evaluation

- Grade scripts against professional benchmarks.
- Get insights on pacing, structure, and character development.
- Compare alternate versions for the strongest narrative impact.

### Character Development

- Define character backstories, motivations, arcs, and interpersonal relationships.
- Receive feedback when actions or dialogue break from characterization.
- Maintain continuity across variants and rewrites.
