# Scene It

**Scene It** is a revolutionary writing tool designed to help writers create, experiment with, and refine stories in an intuitive, scene-driven way. Whether you’re crafting a screenplay, novel, or interactive narrative, Scene It provides a flexible framework for storytelling and AI-assisted guidance.

## Overview

At its core, **Scene It** treats a story as a **linear path of scenes** within a **web of scene drafts**. This approach makes creating and iterating on scripts easier than ever:

- **Scene Variants:** Swap out drafts of a scene on a whim to explore different possibilities without losing your original ideas.
- **AI-Generated Templates:** Don’t know all the details? Write a simple summary, and let AI generate a scene template you can refine.
- **Story Flow Optimization:** Confused which scene fits better or captures character motivations? Let AI suggest the best options.
- **Script Grading:** Curious how your script compares to award-winning works? AI grades your scenes against past Oscar and Emmy winners.
